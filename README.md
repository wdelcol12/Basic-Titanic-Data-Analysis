# Basic-Titanic-Data-Analysis
Titanic Analysis using numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn. (No ML Yet)
Please click on the above file titled Titanic Practice to see the code and the full basic analysis of the titanic sinking. In this analysis, we deduce the events and the people prioritized for the titanic sinking using python and several libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, and pandas. Please note this is my first analysis with big data using python. I plan on learning more advanced techniques in data cleaning and filtering before I start learning predictive analysis with machine learning.
